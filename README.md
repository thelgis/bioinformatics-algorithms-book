# Learning Rust by implementing Bioinformatics algorithms

This is a simple learning project where I will be implementing algorithms from this [Bioinformatics Book](https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org) to become familiar with Rust. 

> WARNING: Since this is a learning project the code may be non-idiomatic or suboptimal.
> If you are knowledgeable in Rust, and stumble upon this repo and spot something that can be improved feel free to 
> open an issue and teach me something :D
