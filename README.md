# Learning Rust by implementing Bioinformatics algorithms

This is a simple learning project where I will be implementing algorithms from this [Bioinformatics Book](https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org) to become familiar with Rust. 

> WARNING: Since this is a learning project the code may be non-idiomatic and/or suboptimal.
